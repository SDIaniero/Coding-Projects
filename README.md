Things I have taught myself using Python, Javascript and Selenium Webdriver via node.js

Hello!
My name is Sal and I've been teaching myself how to code. Originally, I started with learning Python and different techniques using the language. That's why you'll see a bunch of random files with an extension of ".py". When I started working at Preventure, I realized in order for me to use Selenium Webdriver with our salesforce-based platform, I needed to write the scripts in Javascript. So I started learning node.js and javascript. This is why you'll see a lot of file extensions ".js".

Also was practicing quite a lot with HTML and CSS, so those files are also here.
